A work in progress WiFi sniffer using an arduino ESP32 and a network adapter.

The goal with this project is creating a sniffer that can detect a device position in near real time using the [FIND3 Server](https://github.com/schollz/find3)

This does not currently do anything other than output basic information via the serial monitor. This is a very much work in progress when I have the time to tinker around.
